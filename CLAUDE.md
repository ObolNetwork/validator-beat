## What this project is

Validator Beat is a **client-side, public-good self-assessment** for Ethereum validator operators. Six banded questions → six "pizza slices" (each green/yellow/red) → one Stage (0, 1, or 2). The whole thing runs in the browser; nothing is submitted, stored, or fetched at runtime. The static export ships to GitHub Pages.

Authoritative product plan: [`docs/PLAN.md`](./docs/PLAN.md). Read it before changing the rubric, stages, or slice set.

## Domain context: why these six slices

The assessment exists because Ethereum validators have several distinct **single-points-of-failure (SPoF)** that operators routinely conflate or overlook. Obol's distributed-validator-technology (DVT) thesis is that an operator should be able to lose any one piece of their stack — a key custodian, a client, a host, an OS, a CPU vendor, a jurisdiction — without (a) leaking signing power [the "Safety" failure mode, Stage 1] or (b) going offline [the "Liveness" failure mode, Stage 2].

The six slices are deliberately ordered worst-failure-first:

1. **Key Custody** — concentration of signing power (a Safety risk; one compromise can sign with the operator's stake)
2. **Client Diversity** — supermajority-client bug exposure (a Safety risk; refuse-to-attest turns it into mere downtime)
3. **Infrastructure** — hosting-provider concentration (a Liveness risk)
4. **OS Diversity** — distro monoculture (supply-chain risk; can be Safety *or* Liveness depending on the compromise)
5. **CPU Architecture** — ISA monoculture (hardware-level supply-chain / side-channel risk)
6. **Geographic** — jurisdictional concentration (Liveness + censorship risk)

The bottom four slices (Infra / OS / CPU / Geo) **assume the operator runs per-validator DVT or a multiplexer** — i.e. duties are split across independent nodes so diversity translates into uptime rather than just redundancy. This premise is stated in `pages/methodology.tsx` and in each question's `helper` text.

Banding thresholds (⅓ / ⅔) are chosen to map to the consensus-layer math: a ⅔ supermajority can finalize a wrong chain, so any single party holding ⅔ is a red; ⅓ is the safety threshold below which no single party can block or force anything.

```

- **`lib/rubric/`** is the single source of truth for scoring. It exports `SLICES` (the canonical ordered list — also defines pizza slice order and share-code character order), `computeStage`, `blockers`, `getTip`, `shareCode`, `decodeShareCode`. Pure, fully unit-tested.
- **`lib/assessment/questions.ts`** holds question copy + banded options. Each option's `color` is the rubric input — there is no separate scoring step in v0.1; the user's chosen band *is* the slice color.
- **`hooks/useAssessment.ts`** is the state machine (intro → 6 questions → results) with a 420 ms auto-advance after each answer.
- **`pages/[code].tsx`** statically generates **all 729 share pages** (3⁶) at build time via `getStaticPaths` + `lib/theme/share-codes.ts`. Each share URL like `/GYRYGG` rehydrates the assessment to that result.
- **`scripts/generate-og-images.ts`** runs *before* `next build` (see `package.json` `build` script) and pre-renders **729 OG preview PNGs** into `public/og/` via `sharp`. Both the static pages and the OG images must stay in sync with `decodeShareCode`.

### Hard constraints from the static-export setup

- `next.config.js` sets `output: "export"` — **no API routes, no `getServerSideProps`, no runtime image optimization** (`images.unoptimized: true`). All data must be derivable at build time or in the browser.
- `basePath` / `assetPrefix` come from `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`. GitHub Pages project deploys need `/validator-beat`; the custom domain (`validatorbeat.com`) needs it empty. Don't hardcode paths — use `next/link` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (via `constants/index.ts` → `SITE_URL`).
- `trailingSlash: true` — every internal link should match.
- React/ReactDOM are aliased to local copies in both `next.config.js` and `jest.config.ts` to prevent `@obolnetwork/obol-ui` (which bundles its own peer deps) from pulling in a second React. **Don't remove these aliases or the `resolutions` block in `package.json`** without testing.

### Path aliases

`@components/*`, `@constants/*`, `@hooks/*`, `@lib/*`, `@public/*`, `@styles/*` — defined in both `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.ts`. Add new top-level dirs to both if needed.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `yarn dev` | Next dev server on :3000 |
| `yarn test` | Jest (jsdom) — primarily `lib/rubric/*.test.ts` |
| `yarn test -t "all green"` | Run a single test by name |
| `yarn lint` | `next lint` (lints `pages`, `components`, `lib`, `constants`, `scripts`) |
| `yarn tsc --noEmit` | Type-check only (also runs via husky pre-commit on staged files) |
| `yarn build` | `build:og` → `next build` → static `out/` |
| `yarn build:og` | Regenerate the 729 OG PNGs only (slow; run when share-card visuals change) |
| `npx serve out` | Serve the static export locally to verify share pages, OG tags, and trailing slashes |

Pre-commit (husky) runs `yarn test` + `yarn lint`. Lint-staged additionally runs `tsc --noEmit`, ESLint --fix, and Prettier on staged files.

## Conventions worth knowing

- **The rubric is the contract.** If you add, rename, or reorder a slice, you must update: `lib/rubric/types.ts` (`SliceId` union), `lib/rubric/index.ts` (`SLICES`, `TIPS`), `lib/assessment/questions.ts`, the `Pizza` component's slice order, and the share-code length/test (`/^[GYR_]{6}$/` regex in `decodeShareCode`). The share-code character order **is** `SLICES` order — breaking it invalidates every existing share link.
- **Share codes are user-visible URLs.** Six chars, `G`/`Y`/`R`, one per slice. Treat as a stable wire format.
- Stage rules live in one place — `computeStage` in `lib/rubric/index.ts`. Don't reimplement them in components.
- Copy lives close to the rubric: question text in `lib/assessment/questions.ts`, slice `why` and remediation tips in `lib/rubric/index.ts`. Methodology page reads from `SLICES` so descriptions stay in sync.
- Styling is a hybrid: `@obolnetwork/obol-ui` Stitches components (see `components/assessment/stitches.ts`) for the assessment shell, plus plain CSS files in `styles/` (CSS custom properties in `theme-tokens.css` are the palette source of truth — if you change pizza slice colors there, also update `lib/theme/tokens.ts`).

## Deferred work (don't build yet unless asked)

`data/operators/`, `content/methodology/`, `components/operators/`, and `lib/schemas/` are placeholder dirs for the **v1.2 operator registry** (YAML profiles + Zod validation + a `/operators` summary table). `scripts/validate-operators.ts` and `scripts/import-survey-csv.ts` are scaffolding for that phase. v0.1 deliberately does not ship any of this — the `/operators` route currently redirects to `/`.
